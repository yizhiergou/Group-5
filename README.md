#The goal of this project is to create a fully flushed out game of poker using Netbeans/Eclipse. 
#hands will be random generated from the contents of the deck, players can decide 
#to cast bet, fold cards or make a call and rules of poker will be applied when 
#comparing the two hands to determine the winner.
