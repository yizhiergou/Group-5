The goal of this project is to create a fully flushed out game of poker using Netbeans/Eclipse. The game
will initially be a single player playing against the computer. Both hands will be random generated from the
contents of the deck, players can decide to cast bet, fold cards or make a call and rules of poker will be applied when comparing the two hands to determine the
winner.
